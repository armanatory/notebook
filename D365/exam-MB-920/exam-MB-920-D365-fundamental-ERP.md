- **Task recorder**: Allows to record a business process, for different purposes like documenting (export as a word file), or automatic playback of a business process (save as a developer recording, XML Generated code is based on the SysTest Framework and FormAdaptors, which facilitate unit/component testing), also for regression testing aka Regression Suite Automation Tool (RSAT), which is fully integrated with DevOps for executing test cases.

- **Action Pane**:
The Action Pane is a control on a page. When you open a page, for example, the Customer page in the following screenshot, the topmost section of the page is the Action Pane.

A workspace is a one-stop shop for specific activities. Think of workspaces as personalized work centers with data, reports, and transactions that increase efficiency. Workspaces can help drive productivity by:
  - Providing 360-degree views of activities
  - Answering specific questions such as coming invoice dues, ready-to-invoice purchases, number of active POS devices.
  - Providing insights (getting a big picture)
  - Navigating by data
  - Direct access to tasks
